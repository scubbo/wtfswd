get location1
get location2
calculate their midpoint
plot map based at that midpoint (with both locations visible if possible)

TODOS
X Get location from client
* Set (separately?) maximum allowable distance
* Get distance by public transport instead of absolute
X Zoom at appropriate level for distance between
(* Remove markers when you put a new one down)
* Allow drag-drop markers for location
* Filter to certain types of entertainment (drink, dance, food, etc.)
X Set geocoder as window property
* Animate markers going down
* Account for negative numbers in bounding boxes? (Don't *think* I need to, but just check...)
* Usage idea - start with crow-centre, with lines joining to both parties. Allow to "drag" the centre around, showing relative distances. When dropped, calculate transit distance
Set time to depart/arrive
